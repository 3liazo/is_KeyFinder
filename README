KeyFinder is a tool for estimating the musical key of digital recordings, to
aid DJs in harmonic mixing. It's primarily developed as Mac software but I
try to maintain compatibility with Windows. Some users have reported success
in building for Linux.

KeyFinder began as my final project submission during an MSc in Computer Science
at Birkbeck, University of London. My project report, which documents its
algorithms in detail, is available along with a binary download at

Localisations are hosted at https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/is_keyfinder/
