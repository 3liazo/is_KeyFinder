KeyFinder is a tool for estimating the musical key of digital recordings, to
aid DJs in harmonic mixing. It's intended as Mac software but could probably
be ported to Windows and Linux without too much trouble.

It was my final project submission during an MSc in Computer Science at
Birkbeck, University of London. My project report, which documents its
algorithms in detail, is available along with a binary download at
