KeyFinder is a tool for estimating the musical key of digital recordings, to
aid DJs in harmonic mixing. It's primarily developed as Mac software but I
try to maintain cross-platform compatibility with Windows.

It was my final project submission during an MSc in Computer Science at
Birkbeck, University of London. My project report, which documents its
algorithms in detail, is available along with a binary download at
